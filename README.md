# DFCDocBrokerUtility
DFCDocBrokerUtility for Composer

This plugin allows to quickly change the docbroker host/port specified in the Composer\plugins\com.emc.ide.external.dfc_1.0.0\documentum.config\dfc.properties. This is useful when working with several repositories or content servers at once, as it saves you the time to manually modifiy this file when you need to access another repository.
